Module 1 Notes 
# Visualization and Data

## Different types of information visualizations

Boundaries aren't always clear. Many projects combine features from each of the different types.

Book: (Dataclysm)[http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/09/facing-dataclysm.html]

* charts - 

* maps - 

* infographics - combination of information visualizations. PR and Marketing industries hijacked infographics term from News but most of these are "illustrated tables with data" offering shallow collection of numbers, whereas real infographics offer context for numbers, wrapped in a narrative structure. A [good example](http://www.scmp.com/infographics/article/1544125/hunters-and-hunted). The emphasis is in the storytelling side (select datapoints to help people tell the story and guide people thorugh the narrative)


* data visualization - Does not have a narrative component, people explore at will. A [good example](http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/map)

* news applications - Beyond exploring the data, allows you to adapt or shape the visualization so it becomes useful for you. Personalizaton/customization is key.
